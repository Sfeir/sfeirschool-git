# Git 100 â€” Introduction

### Purpose
Welcome to the introduction of the our class for starters in Git.
In this chapter we will introduce what is Git and how it can help you.

##### So what is Git?
Git is a DVCS (Distributed Versioning Control System). Shortly it is a versioning
control system like many wellknown like CVS, SVN, Mergurial and so on.

##### Why should I used it?
Because it is just great ^^.
Actually, git offers many advantages that systems like CVS and SVN do not offer,
it is:

 * faster
 * easier to use
 * more flexible
 * more powerful
 * and has many more qualities

##### What is its principle?
The main characteristic of Git is that it is not server centric. This means that
you **DO NOT** need a centralized server to used it.

Thus, everyone can have a repository on his/her own machine to start using it and
versioning his/her work.

We then speak of _localized_ repository
