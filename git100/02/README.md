#### Purpose

#### How to add a file to a git repository?
The addition of a file to a git repository can be done through two commands. Thes commands are `add` and `stage`. Here after are examples showing their usage:

```
prompt> git add file.txt
```
or
```
prompt> git stage file.txt
```

> **Note:**
> - both commands do the same thing however it's more meaningful to `add` a file when the _git_ does not know it and `stage` it when the system already knows it.
> - you can add several files at once
