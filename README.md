# SFEIR School Git Formation


Welcome to the SFEIR School Git formation.

This github project is here to help sfeir people who want to discover Git.
The class is divided into modules depending on the level. Hence, you can find
different subdirectories who correspond to the level.

There are named as follows :
 - git100
 - git101
 - etc.

 This set of formation might be incomplete so do not hesitate to send me your
